#Expect: The Unix Tool
  
CLI automation is nothing new. Linux users and programmers 
have been automating mindless tasks ever since the 
beginning of time (... maybe an exaggeration). However,
I had never come across a tool *dedicated* to automating 
interactive commandline tasks and programs. Meet Expect- a 
tool for exactly that.
