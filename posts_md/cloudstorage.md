# Object vs Block vs File Level Storage Protocols

For the past four weeks, I have been at IBM Research digging 
down deep into the wild depth that is cloud storage. Before my 
internship, the closest I got to cloud computing was learning 
about computer networking, and I never imagined myself spending 
8+ hours a day working on cloud storage systems. Well, flash forward 
to the current time, where I am so close to file level storage that 
I actually have to consult an engineer that implemented some 
major capabilities of the NetApp filers, because documentation 
only reaches so far.  
  
Well, what exactly _is_ file level storage? If there's a _file_ 
protocol, are there other protocols? Why do we need more than 
one storage protocol? And what is this 'NetApp' filer I 
mentioned? Let's get into it.

### Object Storage
What is this?  
  
  
### Block Storage
What is _this_?  
  
  

### File Storage
What is *this*?
