#Notes
role of beauty in research

ron:
influentials, a lot of impact, thoery/practice in computing

beautiful:
universal? sometimes
plato-universal
hume-individual
"scottish patriot" --> hume

closer to science:
	the most distinct andbeautful statements of any truth
	must take at least the mathematical form henry thoreau

gh hardy: mathematicians patterns must be beautiful

beautiful idea:
	manageable, attractive to others

relational db: early were messes. relational model is beautiful
finite model theory is backbone,

data exchange, more recent example
elegant paper fkmp03
very realtistic, clean

beatiful def:
	always strive to find one
	they may pay off (research!)
	ugly deifnitions wont ever pay off
	wont find any ugly deifnition in ron's work
nice definition is not enough- need to know how to use it

beautiful proofs:
	beauty is the first test, there is no permanent place in the world
	for ugly mathematicians gh hardy
	
	need nice and clean algo

	chess: knight can cover entire board wo touching same square twice
	prove: take ooposite corners out: same color->no, bc knight changes 
		color each move

a beautiful proof can really change things
	0-1 law for first order logic: boring at infinity
fagins proof: most beautiful->for any disjoint sets X Y with n and m nodes ina  graph, there 
	is a node v connected to everything in X and nothing in Y

effects of beautiful solutions:
	must enjoy what we do->worth it
	hard to enjoy ugly things

beauty will save the world dostoevsky

the eye that can appreciate the naked and absolute beauty of a scientific
truth is far more rare that which is attracted to by a moral one
