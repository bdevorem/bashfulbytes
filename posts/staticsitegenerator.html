<h1>Create Your Own Static Website Generator</h1>

<h2>What is a Static Site Generator?</h2>

<p>It's simple: a generator that yields static pages to form a 
static site.  </p>

<p>I'm serious.  </p>

<p>Static sites are the OG of the World Wide Web. When Tim 
Berners-Lee created the first web browser back before my 
generation was born (always late to the party), it was 
more or less simply a document navigator. Documents 
were just files in a hierarchical file system and hyperlinks 
led you from one document to another- just like navigating 
a Unix-like file system. Each document's content was stored 
the same way it was rendered. If you are familiar with the Web 
nowadays, it's obvious that it doesn't work like this 
anymore, due to the demand for dynamic content and 
the need for efficient databases.  </p>

<p>However, some things don't need to be dynamic. Take for 
example this blog: there's no need for 
my content to be rendered dynamically. Most of the content
won't change very often, and the content that does change
will just be new pages. I might eventually run out 
of disk space for my files, but then I'll just migrate 
the site to a VPS. No matter what, generating the HTML 
for the page can happen way before a user first accesses
it, in my scenario. It just makes the most sense to keep 
it simple (,stupid).  </p>

<p>So what is a static site generator? At the most basic 
level, it's a tool that takes content in the form of 
files (typically) and generates a file system-like 
structure of HTML files. Usually, static site generators 
do much more than this: templates can be applied, metadata 
can be gathered, images can be compressed, etc. Rendering 
content statically is generally much faster than rendering 
dynamically, and actually less vulnerable to 
<a href="https://hackertarget.com/attacking-wordpress/">exploits</a>.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Static Site Generator</h2>

<p>So you've decided you want to make a static site and now
you want to choose a static site generator. Well, there are
so many options. Here are the top generators that I looked 
into when designing my site:  </p>

<h4>Jekyll</h4>

<h4>Acrylamid</h4>

<h4>Hugo</h4>

<h4>Hyde</h4>

<h4>Hexo</h4>

<h4>Nikola</h4>

<h4>Pelican</h4>

<h2>Creating You Own Static Site Generator</h2>

<p>If those don't please you, this will give a slight roadmap
on how to create your own simple static site generator.</p>

<h2>How This Site Was Born</h2>

<p>If you've made it this far in the post, you've probably
realized that this site, <a href="http://bashfulbytes.com/">BashfulBytes</a>,
is indeed a static site. When I first decided I wanted to 
create a blog, my mind went straight to 
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> or 
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>,
since I am familiar with those frameworks. But I wanted 
something simpler; I didn't need any bells or whistles, or to
overcomplicate the goal I had in mind. I remembered hearing 
the buzzword 'static site generator' from a class I TA'd for,
where a much-coveted 'Guru Point' was awarded any student 
that created a blog or online portfolio using a static site 
generator. I wasn't familiar with static sites or generators 
at that point, so before I hopped on the bandwagon, I 
took some time to conduct thorough 
research. I didn't want to commit to something that 
wasn't exactly what I wanted (some foreshadowing here...).</p>

<p>My first step was to look into how my 
favorite computer science bloggers manage their blogs. 
I happened across a Quora question about <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-create-a-simple-and-clean-blog-like-matt-might-net">how to achieve 
Matt Might-style blog greatness</a>, to which Matt Might 
answered himself. I really liked his strategy:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Don't engineer myself into a corner. I opt for more abstraction
  and control via shell scripts wherever possible, and I don't 
  make decisions that are going to be hard to undo later.</p></li>
  <li><p>Don't over-engineer it.  I opt for the simplest combination 
  of existing technologies to add the functionality I want.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This solidified my decision to use a static site generator.  </p>

<p>I looked into the most 
popular generators on <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a>,
(because I am a proponent of open source projects) and 
came across all the previously mentioned generators. I 
quickly narrowed it down to the projects written in 
Python, because duh. I was left with Pelican, Hyde, Acrylamid,
and Nikola. I did a brief peek into all of the source code 
first, then I decided to narrow it down to two and then get 
my hands dirty.</p>

<p>Acrylamid was a faster descendant of Pelican, so I 
kicked Pelican off the list. Hyde was just too 
mainstream for me, so I kicked it off the list. Not 
all decisions need to have substantial reasoning. Plus, 
Nikola was named after Nikola Tesla, and Acrylamid has 
amazingly sassy documentation, so it seemed like those 
were meant to be my final picks.  </p>
