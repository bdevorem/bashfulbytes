# Building an IRC Chatbot

For Christmas 2016, my brother got me a 
[Sphero BB8 droid that I lovingly hacked](http://bashfulbytes.com/posts/bb8.html) for a decent 1.5 days 
before I wanted to create an interface to let my club to play around,
as well. The perfect platform: Slack.  
  
[Our club's Slack channel](nd-cse.slack.com) is very active. I'm pretty sure the
entire CS department at Notre Dame is in the chat now, but the small
group that comes to meetings also keeps the rest up to date with their
latest hackings, so neat projects and snippets of code are thrown 
around often. (It's a great learning environment and we love each other,
shameless plug but [check us out](http://ndlug.herokuapp.com/)...)  
So, creating a Slack interface for my BB8 droid was the
proper next step.
