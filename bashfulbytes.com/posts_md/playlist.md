# Let's Talk Music
So I have a very particular taste in music. I dislike saying the
word 'indie' because, who *really* knows what that means? I just
like music that's a bit quirky, different from the usual, but I
also enjoy anything with a good beat or makes me ponder about
life.  

Lately, I've been listening to anything that catalyzes my 
workflow during the day. This ranges from the very sagacious 
Twenty One Pilots and Bastille, reggae fusion like Sticky 
Fingers, and all the way to some good ole rock like The 
Kooks and Hozier. Can't forget the soulful Rationale, as well!
