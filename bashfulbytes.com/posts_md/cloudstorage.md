# Object vs Block vs File Level Storage Protocols

For the past four weeks, I have been at IBM Research digging 
down deep into the wild depth that is cloud storage. Before my 
internship, the closest I got to cloud computing was learning 
about computer networking, and I never imagined myself spending 
8+ hours a day working on cloud storage systems. Well, flash forward 
to the current time, where I am so close to file level cloud storage that 
I actually have to consult an engineer that implemented some 
major capabilities of the NetApp filers, because documentation 
only reaches so far.  
    
So, what exactly *are* object, block, and file level storage?
