# Ethics of IoT

### _rolls eyes_

The movement towards connecting everything you own and its mother to the internet
to create one large cloud with absolute and utter control over your life, whilst
also throwing security out the window, is the most ridiculous thing I have ever 
witnessed in tech. Not only are the tech guys pushing this, but the non-techy 
public is just blindly following. Madness.  
  
This past summer, I was in an IoT/provenance reading group that discussed 
leading research and hot industry topics in the IoT area. Half of the reading 
group was composed of cloud storage and systems storage researchers, and the 
other half were IoT researchers. I was able to witness, first hand, the 
two major opposing arguments for IoT, from industry leaders on both sides. It 
was interesting for me to see because I never really gave the pro-IoT argument
a chance, mainly because I think it's naive.  
  
**Spoiler alert: I still think it's naive.**  
  
Don't get me wrong, I do understand what pro-IoT people want. They see the 
Internet as the end-all, be-all, and they want to take advantage of the cloud. 
They see a house full of internet-capable devices as a house with a white picket
fence. They want their devices to control themselves, to eliminate so-called menial
and trivial everyday tasks that so many people are bored and bothered with.  
  
**When you get lazy, you also get stupid.** And naive.  
  
What the IoT supporters don't know is, if they let their devices control 
*themselves*, they are also letting their devices control *their users*. IoT
people want everyday tasks to be abstracted, to be dealt with on their own. 
However, this requires the users to lose control. No matter how much 
power you think you have, if you are not managing something yourself, you really
have zero control.  
  
This trade-off is something IoT people either gloss over or actually don't see 
as an issue. But to others, this is a priority. Having control over your house,
knowing what actually is going on, is the best way to achieve privacy and security. 
Relying on internet-enabled devices is like relying on an innocent young child to not 
be decieved by a stranger with candy.  
  
As soon as you connect to the internet, you are freely giving away your data. 
Once your data is on the internet, it's on there forever. This happens every time
you access the internet on your computer or your phone. When you have IoT devices
all over your home, you are doing this infinity-fold. And even worse, most IoT devices
have so few security measures in place that they don't even pretend to call
themselves 'secure'. **lol**  
  
**You are basically asking to be hacked.**  
  
I know IoT is the hot new thing. Big data, data mining, IoT, etc. But to me, 
just because something is trending, doesn't mean I am willing to give up my 
privacy (lol tell that to the 14-year-old me that created a Facebook). I 
think to the general public, and even
other tech people, IoT just sounds so cool and fresh and hip. The internet is all
the rage. I think the consequences are often overlooked, and I think people 
don't really care what is happening under the hood. Abstraction, abstraction,
abstraction. But I think there should be a point where take a step back and 
actually start making informed decisions. Ugh this is so annoying.

  It used to take a nation-state to censor information on the Web â€” strongman
  regimes or agencies with spooky contacts in big ISPs. But if any script-kiddie
  can leverage IoT devices with hardcoded passwords to pull selected websites off
  the Net, the game has fundamentally changed.

  If consumers were making an informed decision and that informed decision
  affected no one but themselves, perhaps we could let the matter rest. But
  neither of those conditions are true. Most consumers fail to appreciate the
  consequences of purchasing insecure IoT devices. Worse, such a quantity of
  insecure devices makes the Internet less secure for everyone.
  
  At one level, it's hard to excuse the manufacturers for shipping a product of
  such intimate and personal use with such severe vulnerabilities. But at
  another level, it's hardly surprising. If Microsoft, Apple, Google, and other
  companies with core competencies in software struggle so mightily to secure
  their wares, it only stands to reason these relative newcomers to network
  connectivity would have even bigger challenges. Most IoT devices run a
  version of Linux that will be woefully out of date by the time it's in the
  homes of the people using it.
