# Social and Political Issues in the Computing Industry

Should the computing industry care about social and political issues?
##### Clear answer: *yes*

I'm not sure why this is even a controversial question. Why wouldn't we 
care about the issues faced by the other people in our field? This is our
industry, this is our field, this is how we spend the majority of our 
days... why wouldn't we want to try to eliminate the embedded prejudice?
  
Writing about these particular issues really stresses me out. Because I'm
female and come from a lower class family, I feel like I'm 
expected to have strong feelings about these issues and
to be somewhat aggressive about it. Well, I definitely do have strong 
feelings but I typically shy away from discussing them unless prodded. 
I do not want my thoughts discarded because I've been written off 
as just another bitter and envious person. 
  
I think the computing industry is a scary place for women right now. On 
one hand we are made to feel unfit for the job, and on the other hand 
we are made to feel guilty for having the job.  
  
Being made to feel unfit for the job is not a new thing for me. In fact,
it started in grade school. I remember one particular situation: we 
were learning about negative integers and I tried to help my peer. 
He told me there was no way I could 
be right because I was a girl and girls aren't good at math. 
These situations still happen, and it's over a decade later. 
This summer at work, I was told by a fellow intern that 
I should probably rethink studying Programming Languages 
in graduate school because "it's the hardest research area", and 
you guessed it, I'm female.  
  
Being made to feel guilty for having the job is very new to me.
My first experience with the feeling came only a few months ago, when 
I was bombarded by comments like, "you only got this job because
you're female", "you have more opportunities because you're female", or 
"you'll get into grad school because you're female." 
At first I was shocked and just blew it off, ignoring the sources 
of the comments (because they also were the type to prefer Nano 
to Vim...), but the comments did not stop.
Finally, after three months of their beligerent comments seeping into 
my mind, I started to feel guilty. I 
started to feel like I had an unfair advantage because of my gender 
and that I should recognize my privilege as a female and actively 
take a stand against it.
  
What.  
  
I'll get back to why this is wrong. First, I think it's important 
to note that this idea isn't new or specific to my place of work. 
Many people hold the opinion that the gender diversity problem 
in the computing industry is not a result of discrimination, but 
rather is a result of 
[women being uninterested in the industry](https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/28/women-in-tech-stop-blaming-me/), emanating the idea that women are actually
on the other side of the discrimination. 
  
That's bullshit.  
  
1) Women are not uninterested. Who even came up with this
nonsense? The same person that came up with the idea that
women aren't good at math or coding? The same person who 
explained the previous question by saying women have too 
many emotions that affect their professionalism? There's really
nothing for me to say besides pointing out how nonsensical it is.
Everybody has emotions. Whether or not you let it affect your 
work is less related to your gender and more related to 
your personality characteristics. Not all women let their 
emotions affect their work, just like not all men are 
able to stop their emotions from affecting their work.  
  
2) Discrimination against women is undeniable. Please 
refer to previous paragraph.  
  
Back to why this idea is wrong.  
After a lot of conflicting thoughts, introspection, and 
discussions with some friends back here at Notre Dame, I
realized that I shouldn't feel guilty. In fact, those 
unsagacious opinions of my fellow interns shed light 
on their own introspections,  or lack thereof.
  
Privilege being taken away can feel like discrimination. 
For centuries, men have been given the upperhand. There is 
no way to deny this... 
[Women's Suffrage had to be a thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage).
The computing industry was/is already helping the men in the field-
to level the playing field is to remove those undue advantages. 
Women's initiatives in STEM are a direct response to environments 
that favor men and are oppressive to women, and while on the surface
can look discriminatory, they are actually 
anti-discriminatory and equality-driven in nature. It's foolish 
to feel guilty for finally being given the chance to 
achieve equality. It's not fair 
to say that women are on the other side of the gender 
discrimination in the computing industry because of the 
initiatives that try to bring women into the field. It's also
not fair to say we are gaining undue advantages from these
initiatives. These initiatives are what give women an actual 
chance in the field. The fact that some men still cannot 
understand the importance of these initiatives, or the 
importance of having women in the computing industry 
altogether, really just illuminates the need for these 
exact initiatives.   
 
I'm not saying that every woman shares my experiences. 
I'm also not saying that every man is sexist. What I am
trying to say is that gender discrimintation is real and it
is scary. But what's even scarier is how some people are
still viewing the industry with rose-colored lenses and are
unable to see the prejudice. As a result, I think it is
indeed the industry's duty to try and eliminate these 
prejudices. There is no reason *not* to.  
  
I want to point out that my overall experience at 
Notre Dame lacks much of the discussed discrimination. I am 
very lucky and grateful for my experiences here, but it still 
doesn't really compensate for my overall experience as a female in 
the computing industry, which I think is quite sad.
