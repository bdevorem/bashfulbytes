summary:Where do you see your career headed? Do you plan on staying with one company or do you envision moving from job to job?Is there such thing as company loyalty? Should you be loyal to your company and should your company be loyal to you? How do things such as non-competes and trade secrets influence your opinion? Are these contracts fair? Are they ethical? On the flip side, is job hopping an ethical practice?

#The Dark Side of the Future

I like stability.  
I also like coding and learning and research and trees and dogs and ewoks.  
But really, above all else I like stability.  
  
Honestly, my mind races about 80,000 miles per second, examining every past and future 
conversation, interaction, sensation, expression, misstep, thought, 
opinion, and breath, over and over, forming a never-ending noisy and 
complex sonata in my mind that doesn't give me any time to worry about 
instability in my life.  
So yes, I like stability.  
  
What's shitty about the tech industry nowadays is that I can't expect to 
have stability. In fact, 
[I'm expected to switch companies every few years](http://www.fastcompany.com/3055035/the-future-of-work/you-should-plan-on-switching-jobs-every-three-years-for-the-rest-of-your-). 
The one field I am passionate about, the one field I want to 
spend the rest of my life exploring, the one field that can give me an 
unexplicable calm whilst also sparking a fire in my mind, is 
basically pushing me into the 
one environment that catalyzes the downward spiral of my well-being.  
    
*every. few. years.*  
  
If anything has ever made me want to curl up in a dark, cold hole and anxiously 
wish upon a star that my interests would magically change, this is it. I would 
be lying if I said that stability wasn't a very highly weighted factor in my 
decision to go into academia. It wasn't ranked as highly as my actual interests, 
but it sure proposed a huge pro or con.  
  
So in which direction do I want my career to go?  
I want to go to graduate school, to get a PhD in some mix of 
systems and programming language theory, which produces a life plan for 
at least the next half-decade. After that, I can't predict 
what will happen. I can plan all I want, but no matter what, I can almost 
guarantee that it will not work out the way I anticipate. I could get married, 
I could get pregnant, I could need to move back to California for some reason, 
I could decide I want to go into industrial research (again), 
I could've had it all wrong and decide I want to go into frontend web 
development (jk not likely). Regardless of what happens, I am confident that 
I'll still feel the same way about stability, unless all of a sudden the plague 
that is anxiety resting on my shoulders and slowly gaining control of my mind 
is miraculously lifted. I am not the type of person 
who can handle switching jobs every few years, and I also don't have that desire.  
  
What I desire is to change workplaces only a handful of times in my career, to come home 
to the same place every night, to go to the same
place for work every morning, but manage to consistently have enough intellectual 
stimulation to give me the happiness to maintain a predictable life. Call me
naive, but I think that's feasible for a career in research or academia. One 
way or another, I'll make it happen.   
  
The one good thing I can see from this forced instability of the tech industry
is that company loyalty is less prominent now, as well. If I love a company and
my workplace feels like a home to me, I am all for company loyalty. But companies 
are just as mysterious as the inner-workings of the mind: you could spend years
completely satisfied until one day, something dark is illuminated and you no 
longer find yourself at home. I don't think I should be expected to be loyal to 
a company, because there is no way for me to predict the future and see that 
my company will be loyal back. Even with this doubt, I will support my company 
until they give me a reason not to. Beyond that, I don't think expectations 
of loyalty are fair.
