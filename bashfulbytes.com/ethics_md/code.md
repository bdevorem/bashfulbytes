# Personal Reflection

One thing stood out the most when we sat down to actually pound out our Code of Ethics:
we kept saying "That's common sense; should we add it?". Some things we *did* end up 
adding, like "Don't discriminate", but some things we eventually decided not to, 
because they were so obvious that we assumed any rational human would already live
that way. Aside from that observation, the only other things all four of us were
vehemently in agreement upon were rules 14 and 15: "Don't be a condescending jackass" and
"Use tabs". All of us have experienced those people who peacock...  
####Def. To Peacock (verb): to show off your knowledge in a condescending and  
#### patronizing way, even if said knowledge is not that knowledgeable  
So, we assumed that particular point wasn't common sense, so we made sure to add it. 
Additionally, we all thought people who use spaces are dumb (hypocritical...? nah), 
so we also made sure to add that in our Code.  
  
The most interesting rule in our Code, in my opinion, is "Do not abuse the 
generosity of others." Open source is a big part of my work and my interests, 
and I think the open source world is a key component in the persona of the
computing industry. I think a lot of us, as CS undergrads, take advantage
of the open source world or do not give it as much attention as we should, so 
I'm glad it made its way into our Code of Ethics.  
  
I definitely think there are weaknesses here, mainly because creating a list of 
rules for an entire industry is impossible. There's no way we (or anyone, for
that matter) could create a document that covers every edge case, every 
blurred line, every gray area in the field. We tried to lump everything 
together in "contemplate the potential consequences of your code", but we still 
feel that that leaves things out. Even though some things are left out, I think
that sitting down and discussing these problems is 100% valuable to our 
introspections about our field. Does the value come from the actual code? No...  
I think the value comes from the discussion between my peers and I. We talked 
about the issues we each see, and we shared our own unique perspectives. I think
that's the most important part of this class: seeing the world through 
a different pair of eyes.
