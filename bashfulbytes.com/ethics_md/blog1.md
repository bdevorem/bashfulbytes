# Ethics Introduction

My name is Breanna Devore-McDonald.  
<img class="img-circle" style="float: right;" src="/static/teek.jpg" width="225">

I'm from a mountainous, smallish city in rural Northern California where we actually
have seasons. I have three older brothers who (sometimes lovingly) harass me at every
possible chance, two lovely parents who I adore, and a diverse array of animals of which 
includes my favorite Ewok-dog, Teek (the fluffy thing in the picture).  
Most of my interests lie in the realm of Computer Science, but I do have a *few* unrelated
hobbies. I love tennis, kayaking, YouTube storytimes, espresso, sleeping, acrylic
painting, jogging around St. Joe's lake, and playing with my dogs in my parents' front yard.
Within Computer Science, I am obsessed with the 
[Python Programming Language](https://www.python.org/) and [Linux](https://www.linux.com/),
and I am interested in runtime systems, virtual machines, formal languages, 
and computer language memory management.  
  
  
Why am I studying Computer Science? I'd love to say the reason is that I just want 
to save humanity and help work towards the betterment of society. However, that wouldn't
be the complete truth... because I actually just want to hack everyone.  
  
Just kidding.  
  
Actually, Computer Science is just the most fascinating study I have ever come across. 
The more I learn, the more I *want* to learn and the more passionate I become. I 
wouldn't want to study something that doesn't make me excited every morning when I 
wake up, or that doesn't constantly give me the desire to learn. I am so entranced 
by what computer science is, how it came to be, why it works, how deeply rooted in 
logic and even philosophy it is. I mean, numbers are just made-up mathematical objects,
so what does that say about computer science, a field almost completely composed 
of numbers?  
  
This entire train of thought is what led me to choosing my Computer Science major. I 
came into Notre Dame as an Honors Math major with some undecided Engineering 
double-major. I had experienced a glipse of coding before (I took a C++ community 
college course in high school), but I was never introspective about the content. It 
wasn't until a few weeks into my freshman year, when I started working with LabView, 
that I actually gave it a thought. Why was I more excited to drag around some icons 
on a terrible UI than I was to spend 15+ hours a week proving Calculus? Yes, the 
answer is clearly because spending 15+ hours proving anything is not fun. But, it led 
me into looking at Notre Dame's Computer Science curriculum and researching the 
relationship between pure math and computer science. The rest is history. I guess
I owe LabView a thanks...  
  
  
I'm actually really curious what my peers think about the issues we will be discussing. 
I know my own opinions, for the most part, and I know the opinions of the few people 
I *really* talk to, but I actually have no idea where my class stands as a whole. I'm 
quite terrible at making decisions, so hearing contradictory opinions will probably 
throw me off a bit, but I really want to hear what others have to say, their 
point of view, where their ideas come from. I think it's incredibly important to consider 
multiple views of an issue, so I hope to get out of this class where my peers stand 
and what I can do to understand issues in other ways. I also hope to branch out 
and share my own thoughts, to try and be less afraid to give my personal opinions and
maybe shine a light on a new viewpoint of some issue (doubtful). All in all, there is 
so much I can learn from my peers, and I want to take advantage of this opportunity.  
  
  
  
I think the most pressing issues are AI, privacy, and diversity. AI is so prominent 
now, and has been for a while, and I think it's important to learn more about the issues
that it presents since we will soon be the people helping make those kinds of
decisions. Privacy is always a big issue, but I think it was recently highlighted for me 
during the Pokemon Go wave. At work, everyone was obsessed with the game and it was 
played all day during the workday. However, after two weeks, all the employees were 
cautioned about the app and the AR mode option: we worked at a secure facility and 
since Niantic shares its data with larger data-hungry companies, we could have been 
leaking private company information via camera. This problem really made privacy 
stick out to me as a larger problem than I originally had thought. Lastly, I think 
diversity is also a big problem. It's clear that Computer Science is not the most 
diverse field, and I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts.
