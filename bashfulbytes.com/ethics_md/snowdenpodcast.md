After watching the new movie Snowden, about the controversy surrounding Edward 
Snowden, [Steven Mike](https://stevemikecsethics.wordpress.com) and I decided to 
have a cute little discussion. Click below to hear.

# Personal Reflection

I think Snowden made a good decision, wrapped around a bunch of bad decisions. Overall,
I definitely agree with his decision to leak certain information to the American 
public. Privacy is a big issue and we deserved to know about how our data was 
being collected. However, I'm not entirely sure if Snowden's motivations were
one hundred percent pure, and I think some of what he leaked probably should have 
been kept as government secrets. As civilians, I don't think we should know everything
that happens within the government: there would be no safety that way. But there 
has to be compromise: I also think the government should have a decent level of
transparency. Like I discussed with Steven, I definitely suspected
some level of public spying from the government before the Snowden debacle, but
the leaks still changed the way I view our government. It's a lot different to 
suspect the worst and actually being proven correct.  
  

However, if I were in Snowden's place, I'm not sure if I would have handled it 
any differently. Honestly, I'm too afraid of confrontation and making decisions
that I might have collected the information and passed it on to someone I 
worked with that I trusted, and have them make the decision of what to do. I think 
what Snowden did was very brave, but to some people, like Steven, what he did actually
seemed pretty weak.   
  

All in all, if I had to make one decision out of all of this, it would be that
whistleblowing is the ethical thing to do. If there is very clearly shady stuff 
going on, and the public should or deserves to know about it, for their own 
sake or in order to make a greater change, I think that a person has a right and even a 
duty to leak that information. That said, it takes a lot of courage to actually 
sacrifice your personal and professional life for the greater good. There are 
many tradeoffs. But if silence is the only other option, the clear path to take is to
whistlebow.
