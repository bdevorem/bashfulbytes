# Hello World!
My name is Breanna Devore-McDonald and you have made your way
to my personal weblog. Welcome.   

# About the Blog
BashfulBytes is simply a means to document my various hobby and research hackings, 
along with some neat experiences throughout my journey as a computer scientist and
young researcher. I'll probably also use this blog 
as a consistent source of comedic relief in the future, but that's just a side 
effect.  
  
On this blog, you will find 
the most content on Python and Linux, since those are my hacking 
weapons of choice. If you wanna read about how I generate and host this blog, click

# About Me
<img class="img-circle" style="float: right;" src="/static/teek.jpg" width="225">
I am currently a 4<sup>th</sup> year undergrad computer 
science student at
the [University of Notre Dame](https://cse.nd.edu), and 
hopefully sometime in early 2017 I'll be able to say I am
an incoming first-year PhD student.
Broadly, my main interests lie in programming languages and operating
systems. I am specifically interested in compilers, language design
(especially memory management), 
virtual machines, and automata theory.  
  
# Some Idealism
Oftentimes, I think it's easy to 
focus on _getting things done_, rather than _why things work_. 
Computer science is beautiful. The discipline is handcrafted, 
engineered from the fundamentals of mathematics to essentially
concretize, model, and optimize thought. It's not hard to get stuck
and write off some portion of the science as being irrelevant 
or uninteresting, but it's important to take a step back and 
understand the reasoning behind *why*.  
I think programming languages
and systems research is the ultimate embodiment of this idea.
To me, these two areas come together to form a 
field dedicated to understanding the foundations of computer science, 
understanding the future of computer science, understanding really 
why things work. It's a field dedicated to both the beauty of 
computer science and the applicability.
