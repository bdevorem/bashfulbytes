# Hello!
My name is Breanna Devore-McDonald and you have made your way
to my personal weblog.  

# Why Blog?
Amidst my grad school search, I have come across various weblogs
of computer scientists in industry, research, and academia. Every 
single one has aided my search and/or education in one way or another,
and reading these blogs has become a kind of relaxation for me. The
months leading to grad school applications form a stressful time, and
so I willingly open my arms to any method of relaxing.  
Reading weblogs also got me thinking about who the busy computer 
scientists are behind all the knowledge, and what they do in their
day-to-day life. I realized, that's exactly where I want to be, so 
why not start acting like it now? Surprise! I am now a blogger.

# About Me
<img class="img-circle" style="float: right;" src="/static/teek.jpg" width="225">
I am a rising 4<sup>th</sup> year computer science student at
the [University of Notre Dame](https://cse.nd.edu) and, you 
guessed it, I will be applying to graduate programs in the Fall.
Broadly, my interests lie in programming language research. 
Oftentimes, in undergraduate education (and possibly elsewhere), 
I think it's easy to 
focus on _how to get things done_, rather than _why things work_. 
Computer science is beautiful. The field is handcrafted, 
engineered from the fundamentals of mathematics to essentially
concretize, model, and optimize thought.
Computer science gives everyone the chance to create a 
piece of the world that we live in, all from being able to
concretize the mystery that happens within one's mind.  
Where does programming language research fit into implementing
thought? I think PL forms a large piece of the foundation of 
using computer science to solve problems. PL isn't just 
about making new programming languages or optimizing existing
programming languages. To me, PL research 
is caring about how to better solve computing problems, 
studying how software systems work and why they work, 
analyzing thought and and the amelioration of thought systems,
which altogether forms a field of studying the beauty of computer
science.
