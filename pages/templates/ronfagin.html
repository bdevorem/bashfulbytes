<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>role of beauty in research</p>

<p>ron:
influentials, a lot of impact, thoery/practice in computing</p>

<p>beautiful:
universal? sometimes
plato-universal
hume-individual
"scottish patriot" --> hume</p>

<p>closer to science:
    the most distinct andbeautful statements of any truth
    must take at least the mathematical form henry thoreau</p>

<p>gh hardy: mathematicians patterns must be beautiful</p>

<p>beautiful idea:
    manageable, attractive to others</p>

<p>relational db: early were messes. relational model is beautiful
finite model theory is backbone,</p>

<p>data exchange, more recent example
elegant paper fkmp03
very realtistic, clean</p>

<p>beatiful def:
    always strive to find one
    they may pay off (research!)
    ugly deifnitions wont ever pay off
    wont find any ugly deifnition in ron's work
nice definition is not enough- need to know how to use it</p>

<p>beautiful proofs:
    beauty is the first test, there is no permanent place in the world
    for ugly mathematicians gh hardy</p>

<pre><code>need nice and clean algo

chess: knight can cover entire board wo touching same square twice
prove: take ooposite corners out: same color-&gt;no, bc knight changes 
    color each move
</code></pre>

<p>a beautiful proof can really change things
    0-1 law for first order logic: boring at infinity
fagins proof: most beautiful->for any disjoint sets X Y with n and m nodes ina  graph, there 
    is a node v connected to everything in X and nothing in Y</p>

<p>effects of beautiful solutions:
    must enjoy what we do->worth it
    hard to enjoy ugly things</p>

<p>beauty will save the world dostoevsky</p>

<p>the eye that can appreciate the naked and absolute beauty of a scientific
truth is far more rare that which is attracted to by a moral one</p>
