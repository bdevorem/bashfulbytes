<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>My name is Breanna Devore-McDonald and you have made your way
to my personal weblog.  </p>

<h1>Why Blog?</h1>

<p>Amidst my grad school search, I have come across various weblogs
of computer scientists in industry, research, and academia. Every 
blog I've found shows one key thing in common between the authors: 
passion. I have seen passion for learning and passion for research,
and sometimes I've seen passion for teaching others and advancing
society as well. As I begin my career in research, my own passion 
and excitement is abundant, and I just can't get enough of anything 
that has to do with computer science. So, why not take the cue from 
the computer-scientists-slash-bloggers I've come to look up to? 
Surprise! I am now a blogger, too.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p><img class="img-circle" style="float: right;" src="/static/teek.jpg" width="225">
I am a rising 4<sup>th</sup> year computer science student at
the <a href="https://cse.nd.edu">University of Notre Dame</a> and, I will 
be applying to graduate programs this Fall.
Broadly, my interests lie in programming languages research. I 
am interested in both the systems side and theory side of PL: 
run-time systems (especially garbage collection), 
memory management, security of systems, theory of computation, 
compiler construction and optimization, type systems, 
and DSLs. Someday soon I'll narrow this down.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, I think it's easy to 
focus on <em>getting things done</em>, rather than <em>why things work</em>. 
Computer science is beautiful. The field is handcrafted, 
engineered from the fundamentals of mathematics to essentially
concretize, model, and optimize thought.
Computer science gives everyone the chance to create a 
piece of the world that we live in, all from being able to
concretize the mystery that happens within one's mind. <br />
Where does programming language research fit into implementing
thought? I think PL forms a large piece of the foundation of 
using computer science to solve problems. PL isn't just 
about making new programming languages or optimizing existing
programming languages. To me, PL research 
is caring about how to better solve computing problems, 
studying how software systems work and why they work, 
analyzing thought and and the amelioration of thought systems,
which altogether forms a field of studying the beauty of computer
science.</p>
